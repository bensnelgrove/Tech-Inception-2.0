Joseph is currently studying with RMIT and is enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming. Though his experience with IT is mostly informal, Joseph has learned a lot about both computer software and hardware as well as how to build and maintain his own PC. In his free time, he enjoys playing video games, going to the beach, and hanging out with his partner Eloise and their new kitten Rudy.</p>

								<ol>
									<b><li>Common Elements In Career Plans</li></b>
										<p>The common element that all the members in Tech Inception share in our career plans is the desire to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology degree. We all feel that this is the best way for us all to gain entry in the IT careers we have chosen.
										 Team members Joseph, Benjamin and Brandon share a common element in their career plans which is to continue their education after graduation in order to gain additional qualifications/skills for their chosen fields. For example, Joseph and Ben would like to complete some security related Postgraduate Certificates and Brandon aims to complete his Masters in IT.
										 And the other Team members like Daniela, Varshan and Viktor share the common element of seeking employment in their chosen fields after graduation.</p>

									<b><li>Differences in Job Positions</li></b>
										<p>Tech Inception’s job prospects vary between developers, managers, analysts and ethical hackers. Out of these positions, AI and Automation Developers, Game Designers and Penetration Testers have a similar background in programming, while Data Analyst and IT Managers are quite different. Analysts specialise in data collection and analysis for the purpose of translating that data into meaningful reports to a business while IT Managers focus on managing people and overseeing a company’s technological resources. The various positions require different skill sets and these skills will greatly differentiate each member once they enter the workforce.
										Another difference will be that Benjamin, Daniela, Joseph and Viktor’s ideal job positions afford them the ability to broaden their career profiles in other industries, whereas Brandon and Varshan are restricted to their specific roles within the IT industry.
										For example, Penetration Testers (Joseph and Benjamin), Data Analysts (Daniela) and IT Managers (Viktor) can be employed across multiple industries as these skills are widely needed to help facilitate security policies and Big Data management in a technological driven workforce. However, AI and Automation Developers (Varshan) and Game Designers (Brandon) are more restricted to their lines of expertise and so will be limited to the Automation/AI Industry and Game Industry respectively.</p>

									<b><li>Similarities or differences between career plans</li></b>
										<p>The career plans for Tech Inception are quite similar, which is not surprising considering we are all hoping to gain employment in ICT which is one of the largest growing occupations in the world. Although our educational journeys begin in the same place, our chosen careers will take us down separate paths towards the final few years of study, as we will major in different courses which are more closely related to jobs we wish to pursue. For example, Ben and Joe, who want to pursue Security and Penetration Testing will choose courses such as Software Testing, Unix Systems Administration and Security Testing, Brandon and Varshan will instead choose Programming 1, Further Web Programming and Rapid Application Development as those courses better align with their paths. Furthermore, Brandon might take a minor in Entrepreneurship, Daniela will minor in Finance while Viktor may minor in Management.
										Currently three of the six members of Tech Inception are studying full time, affording Varshan, Joe and Brandon the ability to complete their tertiary education in a timelier manner. While the remainder of the group will complete their Bachelor of Information Technology within 6 years, studying part-time.
										The reason for majority of members in Tech Inception to continue studies is due to the lack of industry experience and wanting to gain more knowledge in the field of IT before gaining employment. Though Viktor has 24 years of experience within the education sector he will continue his tertiary education in order to pursue his career advancement goals.
										The majority of Tech Inception members are seeking postgraduate employment within their desired fields. However, Daniela has a slightly different approach, suggesting she intends to seek work experience whilst studying in order to gain essential industry experience before choosing to apply for a job as a Data Analyst whereas Varshan will look for a job in AI and Automation and Viktor will seek job advancement to apply for executive position at his work after the Bachelor of Information Technology studies.</p>

								<h3>Topic</h3>
								<p>Tech Inception have been busy developing an application that enables the user to make health conscious decisions at the press of a button. Far too often, health takes a back seat while our busy schedule takes priority. But what if the answer to all your questions was in your pocket? Caffeina is an ingeniously engineered application that enables the user to monitor their hydration levels based on the amount of caffeine they have consumed. With coffee being one of the most 		popular beverages consumed worldwide (Conway, 2020), the aim is to ensure that users are keeping up with their recommended water intake and being provided an adequate amount of education regarding the diuretic effects that caffeine can have on the human body (SFGATE, 2018).
								Tech Inception have specifically designed this application to be simplistic, not wanting to add to your health routine, but enhance it. Although this product may very well be in its infancy, later versions empower the user to integrate this application into everyday life, making this the must have app of 2021.</p>

								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>While coffee is arguably the most important ingredient to kick start a successful day, true inspiration was driven by the developer’s love affair with coffee and her interest in fitness and wearable technology. Tech Inception are motivated by the idea that technology can enhance the users' journey to a healthier lifestyle as well as enhance their overall wellbeing. At the same time, the application should not feel like a chore for the user, but a fun enhancement to their lifestyle.</p>

								<h3>Landscape</h3>
								<p>When Caffeina was in the initial planning phase it was inherently important to develop an application that has stand-alone features, both unique to the coffee industry and essential to the consumer. It should also be noted that Caffeina presents as the only application to emphasise the importance of hydration while also enabling the user to track their consumption and enjoy a caffeinated beverage.
									However, similarities between Caffeina's later version releases and competitor applications have been identified. In fact, the application ‘Coffee Order’ allows the user to save their favourite coffee orders, along with the coffee type, milk selection and size (West 2012). This feature can be found in the V2 release of Caffeina, with the introduction of the ‘Favourites Menu’.
									Version 5 of Caffeina allows the client to utilise the integrated barcoding system to scan items for data feedback, in the form of calories. While this may be similar to applications like ‘MyFitnessPal or Equalution’,Version 5 Caffeina database is restricted to caffeinated beverages only and provides added feedback to the user regarding their rehydration requirements.
									While these two examples highlight the comparable features with competitor applications, the products primary function to help monitor hydration levels is second to none.</p>

								<h3>Aim</h3>
								<p>Tech Inception aims to create a user-friendly application to seamlessly integrate into the user's daily fitness and health routine. Motivated by the idea that technology can enhance the users' journey to a healthy lifestyle in addition to their overall wellbeing, Tech Inception wants to ensure that the application use did not feel like a chore for the user but a fun enhancement to their lifestyle. The application is intended to help users ensure that they are keeping up with their recommended water intake and also make sure that they are provided an adequate amount of education regarding the diuretic effects that caffeine can have on the human body.</p>

								<h3>Goals</h3>
								<p>To achieve our main aim stated above, Tech Inception has listed down 4 goals below that we believe we need to achieve along the way to develop the application.</p>

								<h4>Goal 1: Provide Accurate Data to clients</h4>
								<p>Accuracy brings reliability and reliability brings trust. Tech Inception believe that providing valid and accurate data is essential in order to maintain a healthy userbase for our application. Without accuracy, the results are misleading and deter from the core purpose of our application, which is to provide reliable and accurate water intake goals to counteract the diuretic effects that caffeine can cause on the human body. To ensure this doesn’t happen, user trials will be implemented to test various data input/output errors and determine if both the water intake data and the caffeine consumption is reliable and accurate over time. Testing will enable a successful product launch and positive user base.</p>

 								<h4>Goal 2: Simple and User-friendly Design</h4>
								<p>In the initial planning phase, it was identified that one of the most important aspects of application development is in the UX/UI design, as statistics suggest that “70% of customers abandon purchases because of bad user experience” (Priyanka 2020). With this being said, Tech Inception intend to produce a simplistic but interactive application that will enhance the users’ experience while still being able to produce accurate feedback. The development team intend on using an application prototyping platform known as Proto.io, which will allow us to determine our application functionality while employing the UX/UI design best practise protocols. This phase will be supported by a testing phase, where the development team will release the prototype to selected participants for feedback and then adjusting to suit the majority preference.  </p>

								<h4>Goal 3: Prototype of Application through Proto.IO</h4>
								<p>Designing the prototype of our project Caffeina will go through many iterations and changes. While it will require much rethinking, the UI design tool we use will need to be flexible for our needs and be quite powerful. Since our aim is to design an user-friendly, simple and intuitive application that requires minimal training and can easily be learned by anyone who picks it up, our prototype tool should also meet the same requirements to allow us to develop our idea into reality as quickly as possible. Our choice for this tool was Proto.io which is a web-based UI/UX Prototyping tool that will allow us to quickly develop and test our ideas in real-time. It is quite intuitive and provides us with many interactive elements and animations which will make our app look as realistic as possible. It will allow us to design the initial iPhone version of our app as well as give us the option to create versions on wearables like watches at a later time using the same platform. Proto.io also has built in collaboration and review features to make it easy to work together with our team on the design. </p>

								<h4>Goal 4: Utilising React Native and Eclipse for Project Development</h4>
								<p>While app development without an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is possible, it is certainly much easier to do so when using one. Tech Inception’s chosen IDE is Eclipse, with the framework selected to use within this IDE being React Native. It was the group’s decision to use this combination of tools as it had Java support – a language four of the six members are currently learning in their programming module. Later versions of Caffeina will have to make use of a different combination of these tools, as React Native does not support the creation of apps for Apple nor Android wearables. For these platforms, XCode and Android Studio will be used, respectively, to develop compatible apps for these wearable devices. The above-mentioned IDEs were chosen largely due to their online popularity when research was being conducted and also because of their accessibility. We strongly believe that we will be able to produce a working prototype by utilising these platforms.</p>

									<h3> A1 - Caffeina in its Infancy</h3>
									<p>Caffeina has an interesting beginning, what merely started out as a few ideas written on the back of a napkin at Brunetti’s, has turned into the ‘must have’ application of 2021. From the very beginning, Caffeina was designed to be a stand-alone application, with the primary focus on consumer health but more specifically, to provide the user with accurate data regarding rehydration and the diuretic effects that caffeine can have on the human body.</p>
									<P>In order to achieve this idea, version one of Caffeina needs to follow a very strict wireframe that has the capacity to support future projections, like, voice control integration and wearable technology.</p>
									<p>While this idea was still in its infancy, Daniela had plans to create a simple and easy to use interface that was both engaging and interactive for her users. This being said, the coffee selection range was restricted to one complex icon, allowing the user to select their preferred coffee type, such as espresso, milk (filtering options – Cappuccino, Latte and Flat White) or Americano. Daniela’s intended content was minimal, as to not over complicate the basic design    	structure but enough to achieve her desired end state. Changes have been made to this component which are reflected in the final product.</p>
									<p>Originally, it was thought that the application would generate a coffee cup that requires user interaction to help track caffeine intake and daily water consumption. Interactions such as double tapping to indicate a double shot, tap - hold and slide to indicate half strength and sliding the icon to the left would indicate decaf. While this is not overly complicated to develop using a prototype tool, the idea was scrapped when the development team had difficulties coding it, in the appropriate language. Further changes to this section will become apparent later in this report.</p>
									<p>Daniela also identified areas where she envisioned expansion in later versions, which support a more refined coffee selection icon, calorie counting, barcode scanning and also the possibility of linkage between Caffeina and Apple’s health application. Although these goals are quite ambitious, the skills and experience required to reach this level are unachievable in our current capacity. This will become more apparent when the report discusses how the project developed from A1 to A2 and what it looks like as a final product.</p>

									<h3>A2 - Expanding on base Caffeina </h3>
									<p>When Tech Inception was formed at the beginning of A2, the group decided to pursue Daniela’s idea to develop Caffeina. Daniela’s motivation and ideas remained the same, but she now had five other people helping to come up with creative and unique features to add onto her original concept. It was during this assignment that the team was able to expand on additional complex features proposed for Caffeina as well as to introduce completely new features for Caffeina.</p>
									<a><img src="images/statcounter.png" width=100% height=70% alt="statcounter"></a>
									<p>The first major change made to Caffeina was that it would come to both Android and Apple devices in the form of a smartphone application. As can be seen in the above image, the most popular mobile operating system worldwide is Android. However, it also shows that iOS is the most popular choice in Australia but only by a small margin. Though the app will be initially launched in Australia, the team thought it was important to cover all platforms, allowing us to reach a wider audience in the future.Further Version changes were also made to Daniela’s original project idea. Version 2 in Assignment 1 proposed the addition of drip and instant coffee to Caffeina, so Tech Inception expanded on this idea in Assignment 2 by adding different milk type selection, as well as a favourites menu in their Version II. Versions 3 and 4 remained the same across Assignment 1 and 2, adding calorie counting and barcode scanning, respectively.</p>
									<p>Daniela’s idea for Version 5 of Caffeina was to link with Apple Health for better tracking and integration within the iOS platform. As previously stated, Tech Inception decided early on to bring Caffeina to both Android and Apple devices. As such, Tech Inception’s idea for Version V in Assignment 2 was to incorporate wearable device support. It was proposed that Caffeina would see development for Android and Apple watches, giving the user the option of tracking and recording their coffee consumption from their choice of wearable device. From here, there were no more ideas from Daniela’s original project to expand upon, causing Tech Inception to come up with two of their own versions.</p>
									<p>Tech Inception’s ideas for Version VI and VII of Caffeina were quite technical and advanced. The Version VI release would see the integration of Siri and Google Assistant, allowing the user to interact with Caffeina in a hands-free manner. This posed an interesting problem however, as Caffeina was originally being developed as a cross platform app. Due to the limitations of a cross platform development tool, the addition of Siri and Google Assistant would mean that two separate versions would have to be developed – one for Apple and one for Android. If the team were to pursue this, it would require outsourced help.</p>
									<p>Version VII of Tech Inception’s Caffeina proposed the addition of NFC support as well as the production and sale of NFC compatible coffee items like travel mugs, coasters, or stickers. Being the final official version, this had the most ambitious features and like Version VI, would have required third party support. Past this point, there was one more version that was thought off to be implemented but was deemed out of reach given the limitations of the team moving further.</p>
									<p>Tech Inception’s final idea for Caffeina would likely be the hardest to implement due in part to the technical side as well as the requirement of cooperation from businesses. It was planned that Caffeina would integrate with local businesses which would involve the business in question filling out a form detailing the business name and coffee types available. Once this step was complete, Caffeina could then access the user’s location data and show coffee types available when entering a café or coffee shop. This would have provided increased water intake accuracy and improved the app experience considerably. Because of the limitations posed by the team’s lack of experience, it was decided in Assignment 3 to limit the features that Tech Inception would implement in their prototype.</p>

									<h3> A3 - Caffeina Application Development </h3>
									<p> With Caffeina developing wings and getting ready to fly, A3 was established by Tech Inception to provide all the substance the application needs to launch as a passion project. </p>
									<p> Moving forward, Tech Inception decided to focus on further enhancing the features proposed for the application in the limited time available. At the same time, Tech Inception realised that the application functionalities should be tailored to user expectations, ensuring they feel comfortable using the application. These points, supported by our forementioned Aim and Goals, were seen as vital guidelines in furthering development of the application in A3 so that it can benefit the public upon launch. </p>
									<p> As a starting point, discussions were carried out by the team on the scope and limitations of developing the prototype further to get the application to market. Noting that total development time, from start to finish is 15 weeks, Tech Inception will need to reduce the proposed features from A2, to baseline features only. This being said, it is crucial that we balance market expectation with a feasible and user-friendly product, in the required timeframe. </p>
									<p> It was identified early that a realistic version to work towards is V2. Version Two involves a refined list of caffeinated beverages which have been added to the pre-existing selection range. To achieve later versions of Caffeina, Tech Inception will need to hire professional developers and set a reasonable timeframe to produce a successful application, while delivering the features promised in A2.  </p>
									<p> Our next step was to discuss whether to work towards cross-platform development or just limit the application to solely work on Android or Apple. Tech Inception application to be coded and accessible on both Android and iPhone devices, we would need to upskill and develop our programming and application development skills. </p>
									<p> Concurrently, Tech Inception will conduct further research into coffee consumption and its effects on the body. Although programming this particular feature might be beyond our reach, we would like to use scientific evidence and statistics, to support our calorie counting and water consumption guide function with specified items on our menu.  For this to be viable, a formula will be used to convert kilojoules to calories to give the consumer real time information upfront, in an easy to interpret format. This is something that we believe is achievable with our current programming knowledge, but due to time restraints, will not be published in our prototype. </p>
									<p> In order to get a baseline for what the application should look like, Tech Inception generated mock-up designs of the different pages of Caffeina, pooled them together and voted on the preferred designs. Further enhancements to UX/UI designs of the prototype were then made by the team using Proto.IO.  This Proto.IO prototype is being used as the testing platform. </p>
									<p> Testing is being carried out simultaneously by members of Tech Inception to help ensure that the user experience met desired expectations. To aid the testing process, a survey was created and given to a small sample group to generate feedback. This feedback was then reviewed by the team and proved instrumental in improving the usability of Caffeina. It also gave us a sense of how our application was coming along in terms of user experience. </p>
									<p> To launch the application, a promotional video is being used to demonstrate how the application can be incorporated into everyday life. Using the traditional method of a storyboard for planning, Tech Inception team members assisted in sourcing appropriate free stock clips, music and script the voiceover for the video. Once the stock clips, script and storyboard were gathered and finalised, Tech Inception then went on to edit the video using Adobe Premier Pro and HD Movie Maker with a small amount of outside assistance. </p>
									<p> As Caffeina is a passion project we will not be monetising the application, instead, Tech Inception would like to gift this application to the aid the health conscious. Marketing will be predominantly on Google AdSense and social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram. Noting that social influencers have the ability to promote products through their personal profile, Tech Inception will identify an Australian based influencer that can help promote our product online, free of charge. Ideally this person would work closely with our Marketing Manager in order to maximise cliental and help spread the vision of Caffeina. </p>

								<div class="collapsible-target">
									<h3>Roles</h3>

										<p>It is anticipated that organisations with poor structure and a lack of direction will have a high chance of failure compared to organisations that establish structure and set clear goals. In a professional setting, allocating specific roles would seem like the responsible thing to do. Everyone knows their role, has specific responsibilities and a certain amount of expertise can be expected. If we put this altogether, it will provide the group the ability to produce a well-rounded product that meets market expectations, while also being on time and on budget.</p>
										<p>Unfortunately, Tech Inception lack the experience and skills required to allocate specific roles such as Lead Developer or UX/UI Designer. We have found that allocating such roles to members of the team only increases stress and, on some occasions, results in missed deadlines. Instead, we have decided to share the responsibility of developing Caffeina as a team, however, this does not come without its complications.</p>
										<p>Overall, we have found that working to individual strengths and teaching one another how to use certain software or development tools will only increase the experience of the team but also provide the much-needed exposure students require in an introductory subject.</p>

								 <h3> Scope and Limitations</h3>

										<h5> Scopes</h5>
										<p>Tech Inception’s primary objective is to develop a mobile phone application that is able to establish a balance between the caffeine to water intake ratio, while also being reliable and easy for the user to use. Initiated through the use of interactive icons, the user will enter their data based on their caffeine intake, allowing the application to provide feedback on the recommend water intake the user needs to compensate for the diuretic effects that caffeine has on the human body. </p>
										<p>Another objective would be to produce the basics of the application before release date, while prioritising operability and UX/UI design to make the application as appealing as possible with the current skills and capabilities of the team. This includes moving towards different functions such as a favourites menu and data input that includes the various types of coffee as well as a variety of different milk products. </p>

										<h5> Limitations</h5>
										<p> Application development on Caffeina requires us to constantly evaluate our planned features and the feasibility of implementing such features in a timely manner. Although ambitious, we want to avoid the possibility of scope creep and must constrain our expectations and planned functions in line with our timeline. </p>
										<p> These functions include the barcode scanning feature where the user can scan the barcode on their purchased beverage, providing a quicker way of inputting accurate data. The next iteration will include the Apple Watch and Android Smartwatch integrations while Siri and Google Assistant integrations will be introduced in later versions. </p>
										<p> We will be updating our plans regularly to ensure that we give our users a more accurate and informative experience based on feedback. </p>

										<p>Communication between Tech Inception (the group) will predominantly be through MS Teams (Teams), Discord, phone and email. We will use Teams as the primary form of communication, specifically for the groups’ online meetings which are scheduled three times a week with two being recorded and one being an informal non recorded meeting. This non recorded meeting will be an opportunity for the group to touch base and see if we are on track and for members to troubleshoot ideas and concerns. These times have been discussed and negotiated between the group to be appropriate based on the three different time zones, personal lives and work commitments to be Sunday 5pm AEDT, Tuesday 6:30pm AEDT and Thursday 6pm AEDT.</p>
										<p>We will use the Teams ‘Post’ function to contribute ideas and discuss feedback and concerns. We will also use Discord, email and phone to direct message members of the group. This enables all members of the group to get notifications across their chosen platform and respond or acknowledge in a timely manner.  As a challenging aspect of any group is the timely communication between members, it is expected that all correspondence is replied to within 24hours on all mediums. If a member of the group is nonresponsive within this timeframe, we direct message on a different platform or by another user. Once they engage, we ask for an explanation and assurances.</p>
