							<h2>Career Plan Comparisions</h2>
						</button>
						<div class="collapsible-target">

								<ol>
									<b><li>Common Elements In Career Plans</li></b>
										<p>The common element that all the members in Tech Inception share in our career plans is the desire to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology degree. We all feel that this is the best way for us all to gain entry in the IT careers we have chosen.
										 Team members Joseph, Benjamin and Brandon share a common element in their career plans which is to continue their education after graduation in order to gain additional qualifications/skills for their chosen fields. For example, Joseph and Ben would like to complete some security related Postgraduate Certificates and Brandon aims to complete his Masters in IT.
										 And the other Team members like Daniela, Varshan and Viktor share the common element of seeking employment in their chosen fields after graduation.</p>

									<b><li>Differences in Job Positions</li></b>
										<p>Tech Inception’s job prospects vary between developers, managers, analysts and ethical hackers. Out of these positions, AI and Automation Developers, Game Designers and Penetration Testers have a similar background in programming, while Data Analyst and IT Managers are quite different. Analysts specialise in data collection and analysis for the purpose of translating that data into meaningful reports to a business while IT Managers focus on managing people and overseeing a company’s technological resources. The various positions require different skill sets and these skills will greatly differentiate each member once they enter the workforce.
										Another difference will be that Benjamin, Daniela, Joseph and Viktor’s ideal job positions afford them the ability to broaden their career profiles in other industries, whereas Brandon and Varshan are restricted to their specific roles within the IT industry.
										For example, Penetration Testers (Joseph and Benjamin), Data Analysts (Daniela) and IT Managers (Viktor) can be employed across multiple industries as these skills are widely needed to help facilitate security policies and Big Data management in a technological driven workforce. However, AI and Automation Developers (Varshan) and Game Designers (Brandon) are more restricted to their lines of expertise and so will be limited to the Automation/AI Industry and Game Industry respectively.</p>

									<b><li>Similarities or differences between career plans</li></b>
										<p>The career plans for Tech Inception are quite similar, which is not surprising considering we are all hoping to gain employment in ICT which is one of the largest growing occupations in the world. Although our educational journeys begin in the same place, our chosen careers will take us down separate paths towards the final few years of study, as we will major in different courses which are more closely related to jobs we wish to pursue. For example, Ben and Joe, who want to pursue Security and Penetration Testing will choose courses such as Software Testing, Unix Systems Administration and Security Testing, Brandon and Varshan will instead choose Programming 1, Further Web Programming and Rapid Application Development as those courses better align with their paths. Furthermore, Brandon might take a minor in Entrepreneurship, Daniela will minor in Finance while Viktor may minor in Management.
										Currently three of the six members of Tech Inception are studying full time, affording Varshan, Joe and Brandon the ability to complete their tertiary education in a timelier manner. While the remainder of the group will complete their Bachelor of Information Technology within 6 years, studying part-time.
										The reason for majority of members in Tech Inception to continue studies is due to the lack of industry experience and wanting to gain more knowledge in the field of IT before gaining employment. Though Viktor has 24 years of experience within the education sector he will continue his tertiary education in order to pursue his career advancement goals.
										The majority of Tech Inception members are seeking postgraduate employment within their desired fields. However, Daniela has a slightly different approach, suggesting she intends to seek work experience whilst studying in order to gain essential industry experience before choosing to apply for a job as a Data Analyst whereas Varshan will look for a job in AI and Automation and Viktor will seek job advancement to apply for executive position at his work after the Bachelor of Information Technology studies.</p>
